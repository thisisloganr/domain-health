Monitor multiple domains for mission-critical crawling and indexing issues

First, create copies of the following files:

https://datastudio.google.com/s/t3im_Rlj6is

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAuoEFmslQRUijrPA3VLcVLEjCXXByQzlpueq-FTqHs/edit?usp=sharing

Then open the py file and replace the values of all references to Google Sheets or DataStudio

Once you've set up Google CSE and the Google Sheets API, replace the key and cx values with your own
